map.txt - Map formatting specs.

1. Maps will contain:
  . Grouping data
  . Spacial data

2. Spacial Data
  . The simplest form of spacial data is a single area.
  . Represented by a group of four attributes.
  . (x, y, w, h)
  . Spacial data is just that, no metatags can be added to an area.

3. Grouping
  . Groups are what define the properties of their children.
  . The first group defined in a map defenition is considered to be the 'root'
    group.
  . The engine is expected to interpret the metadata from the group and then
    create the appropriate instances of Areas based on the group properites.
  . Groups can be nested.
  . A child group always inherits its parent group components.
  . Attribute grouping is specific to all areas in a group and are expressed
    as an object containing key:value pairs.

4. Reserved Naming
  . COMP - Comma delimited list of Component tags that is inherited by all sub
           groups. Cannot be overridden.
  . ATTR - Component attributes used by crafty. Attributes can be overridden by
           child groups.
  . AREA - An array of area data arrays. Area Data entries are 4 ordered values
           that indicate [ X, Y, Width, Height ], respectively, of an area.

5. Unreserved Names
  . Any other valid javascript variable name will be treated as a sub group of
  . the containing group.

6. Map Components
  . This is a list of proposed map components that need to be created for map
    rendering and behavior.

    MapSolid - Defines a solid, clear map area.
    MapTiled - A single tiled image.
    MapImage - A single map image.
    MapSprite - An animated map sprite.
    MapEntity - A superclass of map component that indicates this map object
      has some sort of interaction (eg; spawners, portals, breakable objects.)

	  
Test Data:

map00 : {  // Root grouping
  COMP : "Map",
  ATTR : { }
  AREA :
  attr : { name: "Area00" }, //

  group00 : {
    comp : "Solid",
    attr : { }
    area : [
      [0, 0, 5, 5],
      [5, 0, 10, 10],
      [32, 32, 100, 16]
    ]
  },
  group01 : {
    comp : "Portal"
    portal0 : {
      attr : { exit: "portal1" },
      area : { [10, 10, 15, 15 ]}
    }
    portal1 : {
      attr : { exit: "portal0" },
      area : { [100, 10, 15, 15]}
    }
  },
  group02 : {
    COMP : "SPAWN",
    zombies : {
      ATTR : { type: "Zombie" }
      AREA : [ [16, 16, 1, 1],
               [32, 16, 1, 1] ]
    },
    toads : {
      ATTR : { type: "Toad" },
      AREA : [ [16, 8, 1, 1] ]
      fatToad : {
        ATTR : { hp: 9999 },
        AREA : [ [32, 8, 1, 1] ]
      }
    },
